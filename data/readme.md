# Pokemon Classification Task

This task involves classifying Pokemon images based on their type. The images and a CSV file with information about the Pokemon are provided in the `/images` and `/data` directories respectively.

## Task Details

Participants are required to perform exploratory data analysis on the given data and then train a machine learning model to classify the Pokemon images into two types - Water and Fire. Additionally, they can also try classifying the images into three types - Water, Normal, and Grass.

After training the model, participants are required to deploy the model using a suitable framework such as Streamlit or Gradio. Participants should also report their observations and insights gained from this task.

## Data Description

The data for this task consists of Pokemon images and a CSV file with information about the Pokemon. The `/images` directory contains the images of the Pokemon, while the `/data` directory contains the `pokemon.csv` file, which contains the following columns:

* `Name`: Name of the Pokemon.
* `Type`: Primary type of the Pokemon.

## Task Steps

1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the given data to gain insights into the data and prepare it for training the model. EDA can include data cleaning, data visualization, and feature engineering.
2. Train a machine learning/deep learning model using the prepared data to classify the Pokemon images into two types - Water and Fire. Participants can use any suitable machine learning algorithm. Additionally, they can also try classifying the images into three types - Water, Normal, and Grass.
3. Deploy the trained model using a suitable framework such as Streamlit or Gradio to create a user interface where users can upload an image of a Pokemon and get its classification.
4. Report observations and insights gained from this task, including the accuracy of the model, any challenges faced during the task, and potential improvements that can be made.

## Submission Guidelines

Participants should submit their code and a report containing the following:

* EDA findings and insights
* Description of the machine learning model used, including hyperparameters and evaluation metrics
* Description of the deployed interface and how to use it
* Observations and insights gained from this task, including any challenges faced and potential improvements

The code and report should be submitted as GitHub link with participants name and register number in the readme.md file
